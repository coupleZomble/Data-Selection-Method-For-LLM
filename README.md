# Data-Selection-Method-For-LLM

This project has implemented some baseline algorithms for data selection in large models.

## 1. Embedding base method
These algorithms rely on the embeddings generated by the embedding model for direct similarity measurement of data.
### Optimized algorithm:
#### k center greedy
1. By dividing the matrix, it is possible to calculate the similarity of more data.

2. Optimized the implementation of the k-center Greedy algorithm to reduce the time complexity to `O(nlogn)`

## 2. Loss base method
This type of algorithm relies on the loss generated by the generative model on the training data to generate corresponding metrics, and sets specific thresholds to select data.
